# Raise3D Tool

A set of utilities for monitoring Raise3D 3D printers, and a Swift wrapper for the printer’s REST API.

## Motivation

I was printing with some old filament that kept breaking. I wouldn’t notice until hours later, wasting
precious time. So I built a crude tool to send a push notification to my phone if the printer reported an
error.
